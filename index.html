        <h1>Difference between var let and const</h1>
        <p><b>var<b> :- 1) variable declared with var have global and local execution
               <pre>
                example:- 
                var number=20; //global 
                function print(){
                    var b=10 //local
                    console.log(number) //20
                }
                console.log(b) //reference error b is not defined 
              </pre>
                   2) varibale declared with var can be redecalred and reassigned
                   <pre>
                    example:-  redeclaring a
                    var a=10;
                    console.log(a) //10
                    var a=30;
                    console.log(a)//10
                    <hr>
                    example:- reassigning a
                    var a=10;
                    console.log(a);//10
                    a=20;
                    console.log(a);//10
                   </pre>
                  3) varibale declared with var is hoisted to the top of their global or local scope with initial value as undefined 
                  <pre>
                    console.log(a)
                    var a=10;//undefined  ---> only declaration is hoisted assignment is not hoisted
                    console.log(a) // 10
                  </pre>
                  
        </p>
        <p><b>let</b>:- 1)variable declared with let has local global, and block level scope
        <pre>
            function print(){
                if(5>1){
                    let a=20;
                    let b=10;
                    console.log(b) //10
                }
                console.log(a)// reference error a  not declared 
            }
        </pre> 
        2) varibale decalred with let can be reassigned but not redeclared
        <pre>
            let a=10;
            console.log(a) //10
            a=20;
            console.log(a)//20
            let a=30;
            console.log(a)// syntax error identifier a is already declared 
        </pre>
        3) varible declared with var let can be hoisted to the top of local global and block but not initialized
        <pre>
            console.log(a); // cannot access a without initialization
            let a=10 
        </pre>
    </p>     
        <p><b>const</b> :-1) variable declared with const has local ,global and block level scope same as let 
            2) variable declared with const cannot be reassigned and redeclared 
            <pre>
             const a=10;
             const a=20; //synatx error a is alredy been declared 
             <hr>
             const a=10;
             a=20;//type error assignement to const variable 
            </pre>
            3) variable declared with const are hoisted same as  let  not with default initialization gives reference error
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div><h1>what is hoisting ?</h1>
    <p> hoisting is a default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope</p></div> 
    <div><h1>what is temporaldead zone(TDZ)</h1>
    <P>A let or const variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until code<br>
         execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized. While inside the TDZ, the <br>variable has
         not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a ReferenceError </P>
        <pre>
              if(true){
                console.log(a); //a is in temporal dead zone

                let a=12;
              }
        </pre>cv    </div>
    <div> <h1>what is meant by first class function?</h1>
    <P> functions in called as the first class function when they are treated like other variables. So the functions can be<br>
         assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function.
        <pre>
            function sayHello(name){
                console.log(`hello,${name}`);
            }
            const greeting=sayHello;
            greeting("prepbytes");
        </pre></P></div>
        <div><h1>what are pure functions?</h1>
        <p>a functions which always returns the same results if the same arguments are passed</p>
    <pre>
        function calculategst(price){
                console.log(price*0.5)
        }
        calculategst(23) //pure function bcz it gives same output when price is passed the output <br>
        doesnot depends on any third variable for example price*tax/100 ....>here the output depends tax variable 
    </pre></div>
